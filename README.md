## Welcome to PLEX-GR00T GitHub Pages

some information about this project is that it contains amazing OpenCV basic tutorials with dataset of photos on which this tutorial is based on.

Note: I implemented this project in the Ubuntu 18.04, so if you are working on Windows you just need to change the path set for the photos 
      in which it has been used.
      
Hope it will help.
